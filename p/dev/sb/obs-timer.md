# **âŒ› OBS Timer for StreamerBot**
### **A Flexible Countdown Timer for Starting Soon and BRB Scenes**

After weeks of tinkering, learning, and fine-tuning, Iâ€™m thrilled to share this timer script! :tada:  
Iâ€™m not a developerâ€”just learning as I goâ€”but Iâ€™ve built something functional and flexible, perfect for enhancing your stream. Itâ€™s not perfect, but with your feedback and impressions, I can make it even better. Let me know what you think!  

## **What This Timer Does**
- **Perfect for Starting Soon or Pause Scenes**: Automatically display a countdown on OBS to inform your viewers.  
- **Highly Customizable**: 
  - Define your timer duration and actions directly in StreamerBot.  
  - Customize the appearance and style of the timer in OBS.  
- **Flexible Triggering**: Activate the timer from any StreamerBot triggerâ€”chat commands, channel points, subscriptions, or custom actions.  
- **Dynamic End Actions**: Automatically display a message, switch scenes, or restart the timer when it ends.  

## **How to Use It**
### Required Arguments:
1. **`textSourceName`**: The OBS GDI Text source to display the timer countdown.  
2. **`timerStart`**: The starting countdown duration, either in `hh:mm:ss` or `mm:ss` format.  
3. **`timerOutcome`**: What happens when the timer ends:  
> - **Set to `"message"`**: Displays the value of `actionDetail` as text in OBS.  
> - **Set to `"scene"`**: Switches to the OBS scene specified in `actionDetail`.  
> - **Set to `"restart"`**: Restarts the timer with the original duration from `timerStart`.  

4. **`actionDetail`**: Specifies the message or OBS scene name for the end action.  
> - *Example*: `"Break is over!"` (for messages) or `"LiveScene"` (for scene changes).

## **Examples**
### 1. **Countdown with a Message**
- **Arguments**:
  - `textSourceName`: `"CountdownTimer"`  
  - `timerStart`: `"02:30"`  
  - `timerOutcome`: `"message"`  
  - `actionDetail`: `"Let's Go!"`  
- **Result**: The timer starts from 2:30 and displays `"Let's Go!"` when it ends.
### 2. **Switch Scenes Automatically**
- **Arguments**:
  - `textSourceName`: `"Timer"`  
  - `timerStart`: `"05:00"`  
  - `timerOutcome`: `"scene"`  
  - `actionDetail`: `"LiveScene"`  
- **Result**: The timer starts from 5:00 and switches to the OBS scene `"LiveScene"` when it ends.
### 3. **Restart Timer in a Loop**
- **Arguments**:
  - `textSourceName`: `"CountdownTimer"`  
  - `timerStart`: `"01:00"`  
  - `timerOutcome`: `"restart"`  
- **Result**: The timer starts from 1:00 and restarts to 1:00 when it reaches 0.
### 4. **Let the Timer Continue into Negative Time**
* **Arguments**:
  * `textSourceName`: `"CountdownTimer"`
  * `timerStart`: `"00:30"`
  * `timerOutcome`: `"continue"`
* **Result**: The timer starts from 30 seconds, reaches 0, then continues into negative time (e.g., `-00:01`, `-00:02`, ...).
:::warning
The timer stops automatically after reaching **-2:00** to avoid running indefinitely. Editable in the script, line 8.

## **Why Youâ€™ll Love It**
- **Streamlined for Streamers**: Simplifies scene transitions and break management with automated countdowns.  
- **Easy to Use**: Fully configurable within StreamerBot without modifying the script.  
- **Collaborative and Open-Ended**: I built this while learning and am open to feedback to make it even better!
